# Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning in Audio Large Language Models - Reference Analysis
主要看 audio reasoner 和 sari这两篇，reasoner把cot思维链介绍到qwen2上，然后他们多层的思维链想法挺好的，然后是sari介绍了将grpo引入到audio model中来，最后可以看看gama对于音频经过encoder后进入llm的前置处理。
## Overview
This table analyzes four key papers that explore Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), representing the cutting-edge research in audio reasoning and understanding.

| Paper | Authors | Year | Key Contribution | CoT Method | Audio Domains | Performance Gains | Limitations |
|-------|---------|------|------------------|------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **[GAMA: A Large Audio-Language Model with Advanced Audio Understanding and Complex Reasoning Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11768)** | Ghosh et al. | 2024 | First LALM with integrated Audio Q-Former and CompA-R dataset for complex reasoning | CompA-R (Instruction-Tuning for Complex Audio Reasoning) with soft prompts using event tags | Non-speech sounds, non-verbal speech | 1%-84% improvement over existing LALMs | Limited to synthetic instruction-tuning data |
| **[Audio-CoT: Exploring Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Audio Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07246)** | Ma et al. | 2025 | First systematic exploration of CoT methods in LALMs across multiple audio domains | Traditional CoT prompting adapted for audio tasks | Sound, music, speech | Significant improvement on easy/medium tasks | CoT confuses model on hard tasks; reasoning chains can reduce accuracy |
| **[SARI: Structured Audio Reasoning via Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15900)** | Wen et al. | 2025 | Extends GRPO framework to LALMs with structured reasoning and curriculum learning | Two-stage: SFT on structured/unstructured CoT + curriculum-guided GRPO | Multiple-choice audio reasoning | 16.35% improvement over Qwen2-Audio-7B; 67.08% on MMAU test-mini | Requires extensive curriculum design and RL training |
| **[Audio-Reasoner: Improving Reasoning Capability in Large Audio Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02318)** | Xie et al. | 2025 | Large-scale audio reasoning dataset (CoTA) with 1.2M samples and structured CoT training | Structured CoT process with secondary labeling and QA generation | Diverse multi-task audio scenarios | +25.42% on MMAU-mini, +14.57%/+10.13% on AIR-Bench, +8.01% on MELD | Dependency on closed-source models for labeling |
